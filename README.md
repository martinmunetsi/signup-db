## The Entityâ€“relationship model
The user database "users_db" is comprised of 3 tables namely users,pswd and pswd_hist.
The users table contains the sign up user id,name and contact details. The user_id is the primary key field on the users table.
Child tables such as pswd and pswd_hist reference the users table through a foreign key on user_id. 
The pswd table will store a Hash of the user password and will keep state of whether the password is locked. The user_id also has a UNIQUE constraint on the pswd table.
The pswd_hist table keeps the history of the passwords hashes.
